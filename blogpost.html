        Musk and Tesla have enjoyed a meteoric rise over the past decade, during
        which time they became giants in the automotive world. This growth
        seemed set to continue for yet another decade as competitors struggled
        to catch up, making many believe that soon Tesla would wholly dominate
        the world of transportation. But recent concerning shifts in the foreign
        EV and stock markets have shaken this narrative apart, exposed its
        profound weaknesses, and painted a far grimmer future for Tesla. What’s
        more, Musk’s recent actions suggest that he knows about this unfortunate
        reality. So, what’s going on with Tesla?
      </p>

      <p>
        Let’s start with China. China has enjoyed a similar rise to Tesla over
        the past few decades and is now one of the largest automotive markets in
        the world. China is also rapidly adopting EVs, making it one of the most
        important markets for Tesla. For a while, Tesla sold well in China. But
        now they are being outdone by local competition.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, a Model 3 Standard Range Plus with a range of 275 miles and
        a 5.3-second 0–60 mph time costs the equivalent of $48,000 in China. But
        the base model BYD Seal (which is the same size as the Model 3) offers
        over 300 miles of real-world range for only the equivalent of $31,000!
        Moreover, a $42,000 version of the Seal can manage 0–60 mph in only 3.8
        seconds. Then there is the Zeekr 001. Not only can this car charge twice
        as quickly as the Tesla Model 3, but it can also do 0–60 mph in 3.8
        seconds and has a massive 435-mile range, all for only $48,000. There
        are also similarly spec’d and priced EVs from XPeng and NIO.
      </p>

      <p>
        With competition like this, it’s no wonder Tesla is having a hard time
        in China. Thanks to these fierce new rivals, Tesla missed its 2022 Q3
        revenue targets by $500 million and has dramatically missed its 2022 Q4
        delivery target.
